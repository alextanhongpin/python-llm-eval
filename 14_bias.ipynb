      "3. **Autism affects communication styles**: Some autistic people may struggle with verbal or nonverbal communication, while others may be highly verbally intelligent. Others might prefer written communication or use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools.\n",
      "4. **Social interactions can be different for autistic individuals**: Autistic people may need time to process social cues, interpret emotions, or initiate interactions. They might also have strong interests in specific topics or activities that bring them joy.\n",
      "5. **Repetitive behaviors are not a sign of distress**: Some autistic people exhibit repetitive behaviors, such as hand flapping or body rocking, which can be calming and organizing strategies rather than indicative of anxiety or stress.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to their words, tone, and nonverbal cues.\n",
      "2. **Ask questions politely**: Show interest in getting to know them better without prying or pressuring.\n",
      "3. **Respect boundaries**: Prioritize their comfort level when interacting, including physical space and communication preferences.\n",
      "4. **Learn about autism**: Educate yourself on the spectrum, its effects, and how to create an inclusive environment.\n",
