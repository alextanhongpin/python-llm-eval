    "# Evaluating LLM using LLM\n",
    "LLMs can be used to evaluate other LLMs by leveraging their ability to generate text, translate languages, and answer questions. This approach offers several potential benefits, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: LLMs can quickly evaluate large datasets of text, overcoming the time and resource limitations of human evaluation.\n",
    "- **Objectivity**: LLMs can be less prone to bias than human evaluators, potentially leading to more consistent and fair assessments.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: LLMs can be tailored to specific evaluation tasks and criteria by providing appropriate prompts and instructions.\n"
